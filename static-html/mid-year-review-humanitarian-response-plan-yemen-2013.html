<p>
	Humanitarian needs and the underlying context in the Republic of Yemen remain largely unchanged since the Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan (YHRP) was published in December 2012.&nbsp; An estimated 13.1 million people require humanitarian aid across the country.&nbsp; Due to access, security, implementation capacity and resource constraints, humanitarian partners are targeting 7.7 million people for the year.</p>
<p>
	Several events in 2013 have created a crucial opportunity to promote durable and sustainable solutions to the Yemeni crisis.&nbsp; Adjustments to existing programmes mostly involve efforts to take advantage of this opportunity by incorporating early recovery into life-saving activities, which will also help entrench the benefits of humanitarian investments to date.&nbsp; As a result of improved prioritization and focus for the remaining part of 2013, requirements for the humanitarian response in Yemen have decreased slightly to US$702,334,398.<a href="http://www.unocha.org/cap/node/add/story-appeals#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1" title="">[1]</a>&nbsp;Humanitarian partners are committed to diversifying the donor base&mdash;including to Gulf countries and the private sector&mdash;to fund these requirements.&nbsp; Within high-priority projects, partners have identified the most critical activities for the rest of the year in an effort to facilitate quick funding decisions that will immediately help those with the most urgent needs.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	<strong>Strategy for the remainder of 2013 </strong></p>
<p>
	The spirit of the overall 2013 YHRP strategy remains unchanged.&nbsp; For the rest of the year, the guiding purposes of humanitarian action in Yemen are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
		Save lives and prevent further increases in mortality through the provision of nutrition, water and sanitation, primary health services, and food aid.</li>
<li>
		Promote resilience and early recovery by improving agricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods assets.</li>
<li>
		Strengthen the response to violations of human rights and international humanitarian law, and improve the protection of vulnerable and conflict-affected people.</li>
<li>
		Reinforce the evidence base and sustainability of humanitarian action by building local capacity and promoting cluster cooperation on assessments and programmes.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<p>
	&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Partners have improved the strategic objectives by refining terminology and revising several indicators to ensure they are measurable and clearly linked the objectives.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Cluster response plans and progress to date</strong></p>
<p>
	Like the overarching strategy, cluster response plans have changed little, and progress to date is mostly on target despite limited resources.&nbsp; Noteworthy is that many clusters have reached an important percentage of their targets despite low funding levels.&nbsp; This was made possible in part by focusing on high-impact projects and by reducing food rations, while strengthening coordinated interventions and continuing to invest in community level structures through capacity-building and local empowerment.&nbsp; Funds received by partners late in the last quarter of 2012 also contributed to the provision of humanitarian aid in the first quarter of 2013.&nbsp; However, the need to sustain funding well into the remainder of the year is critical to maintain such a momentum.&nbsp;</p>
<p>
	Going forward, clusters will make their programmes more sustainable, including by shifting from mobile to fixed assistance and strengthening local capacity.&nbsp; Also, government participation in the cluster system at national and sub-national level remains critical, particularly during the on-going political transition period in Yemen.&nbsp; Several ministries are playing key roles in some clusters, including in the Health, Education, WASH, and Nutrition Clusters and the Sub-Clusters on Child Protection and Gender-based Violence (GBV).&nbsp; Such efforts will support resilience by bolstering the infrastructure and personnel that provide basic services while maintaining necessary life-saving activities.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>
		<strong>Camp Coordination and Camp Management (CCCM), Shelter and NFIs (non-food items) Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The CCCM/Shelter/NFI Cluster is seeking $39.5 million to support 463,060 internally displaced people (IDPs), returnees and vulnerable people with shelter and basic household items.&nbsp; As part of this key objective, the cluster is prioritizing vulnerable people in the north, as this group often ranks among the most destitute.&nbsp; With 33.6% of its requirements met, the cluster has reached 237,951 people to date.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Coordination and Common Services:</strong>&nbsp; Coordination and common services facilitate the work of all clusters.&nbsp; For the rest of the year, the focus will be on resource mobilization (including outreach to Gulf countries and the private sector); information management; access and security information; and greater support to national non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from pooled funds.&nbsp; OCHA, the international NGO Information Management and Mine Action Programs (iMMAP) and UNDSS are requesting $5.8 million to ensure these services will benefit the wider humanitarian community.&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Early Recovery Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The Early Recovery Cluster seeks $37.6 million to help nearly one million vulnerable and conflict-affected people resume normal life.&nbsp; Major activities include mine action, capacity-building of national NGOs and non-agricultural livelihoods.&nbsp; Recognizing its central role in creating durable solutions, the cluster will continue to prioritize mine action and livelihoods promotion in post-conflict areas for the rest of the year.&nbsp; With 8.3% of its funding requirements met, the Cluster has reached 53,829 people.&nbsp; Another 115,472 people living in areas cleared by mine action have benefited indirectly.&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Education Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The Education Cluster is seeking $19.4 million to ensure quality education and related services for 622,300 people.&nbsp; As part of this urgent objective, the cluster will prioritize activities in the north of Yemen in order to redress discrepancies in programming which has mostly focused on the south.&nbsp; With 14% of its funding requirements met, the cluster has reached 323,909 people to date.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Food Security and Agriculture Cluster (FSAC):</strong>&nbsp; The FSA Cluster is seeking $283.8 million to provide urgent food and livelihoods assistance to 6.9 million Yemenis.&nbsp; In parallel to its life-saving services, the cluster will prioritize solutions to chronic food insecurity and promote self-sufficiency.&nbsp; With 51.2% of its funding requirements met, the cluster has reached 4.3 million people to date.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Health Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The Health Cluster is seeking $59.3 million to provide emergency health assistance for 4.2 million people.&nbsp; This includes support for primary and secondary health services, capacity-building and disease monitoring and surveillance.&nbsp; Along with its life-saving programmes, the cluster will prioritize greater sustainability in its activities, training, community mobilization, and disease surveillance and management.&nbsp; With 19.3% of its funding requirements met, the cluster has reached just over one million people to date.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Logistics Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The Logistics Cluster is seeking $1.6 million for services that are critical to humanitarian operations, including providing supply chain information, air transport and fuel supplies.&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Multi-Sector: Refugees, Asylum-Seekers and Migrants:</strong>&nbsp; The multi-sector requires $51 million to provide basic services to refugees, asylum-seekers ($41.7 million) and vulnerable migrants ($9.3 million).&nbsp; These people are often in acute distress and need urgent assistance.&nbsp; Within this objective, the multi-sector will prioritize life-saving assistance, advocacy, capacity-building and support for voluntary returns of stranded and destitute migrants.&nbsp; To date, with 36.2% of financial requirement met (13% for migrants and 41.3% for refugees/asylum seekers), partners have reached 258,653 people (13,811 migrants and 244,842 refugees/asylum seekers) of the targeted 315,000 people.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Nutrition Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The Nutrition Cluster is seeking $96 million to treat and prevent malnutrition and its devastating consequences across Yemen.&nbsp; As part of this critical objective, the Cluster will prioritize activities in the highest-need areas (Sa&rsquo;ada, Al-Jawf, Abyan, Aden and Lahj Governorates) to treat acute malnutrition and address underlying causes.&nbsp; With 37.5% of its funding requirements met, the cluster has reached 282,171 people out of a target of 691,000.<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Protection Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; Protection Cluster partners require $42.3 million to monitor and respond to rights violations&mdash;including against women and children&mdash;and support a stronger protective environment.&nbsp; The cluster will do this through consolidating social networks and strengthening communities&rsquo; existing capacities to reduce risks and address immediate protection concerns.&nbsp; Within this objective, partners will prioritize the protection of vulnerable IDPs, returnees and conflict-affected people, particularly in the north.&nbsp; With only 15.3% of its funding requirements met, the Protection Cluster and GBV Sub-cluster to date have reached 647,886 people out of a target of 858,356 people, while the Child Protection Sub-cluster has reached 375,961 children out of a target of 500,849.&nbsp; Significant progress was also made through the development of a national IDP policy.&nbsp;<br />
		&nbsp;</li>
<li>
		<strong>Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Cluster:</strong>&nbsp; The WASH Cluster is seeking $66 million to provide clean water, sanitation and hygiene promotion for 2.6 million vulnerable people in Yemen.&nbsp; Major priorities for the rest of the year include WASH support for returnees in the south; greater attention to access to water, sanitation and hygiene services in rural areas and infrastructure in the south; and expanding services in the north.&nbsp; With only 18.3% of its funding requirements met, the cluster has reached 432,590 people to date, including about 192,000 who were given access to clean drinking water.</li>
